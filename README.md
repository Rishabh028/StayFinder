## Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these steps to set up and run StayFinder on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm)
* **MongoDB Atlas Account**: [Create a free account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and set up a cluster. Make sure to whitelist your current IP address or allow access from anywhere (for development purposes) in your Atlas Network Access settings.
```

### 🕹️2.Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the project root:**
    ```bash
    cd StayFinder
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can use a live server extension (e.g., Live Server for VS Code) for convenience.

    **Important:** For local testing with your local backend, you might need to temporarily change the API URLs in `script.js` from `https://stayfinder-1-cfu4.onrender.com` back to `http://localhost:5000`. Remember to change them back before deploying!
    
### 🤖Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Rishabh028/StayFinder.git](https://github.com/Rishabh028/StayFinder.git)
    cd StayFinder/backend
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the `backend` directory, create a file named `.env` and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string and a JWT secret:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key_for_jwt
    ```
    Replace `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` with your actual connection string from MongoDB Atlas (remember to replace `<password>` and `<dbname>` placeholders).

4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
    The server should start on `http://localhost:5000`.

##🎈 Deployment

StayFinder is designed for easy deployment of its decoupled frontend and backend.

### 🤖Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

The frontend is deployed as a static site using **Netlify**.

1.  **Push your frontend code** (everything except the `backend` folder) to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Connect your GitHub repository** to Netlify.
3.  Netlify will automatically detect your `index.html` and deploy the site.
4.  **Update backend API URLs:** After deploying your backend (see below), ensure all `fetch` calls in your `script.js` point to your live backend URL (e.g., `https://stayfinder-1-cfu4.onrender.com`). Then, push these changes to your frontend repository to trigger a Netlify redeploy.

### 🕹️Backend Deployment (Render)

The backend Node.js API is deployed using **Render**.

1.  **Push your entire project** (including the `backend` folder) to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a new Web Service** on Render and connect it to your GitHub repository.
3.  **Configure Build & Start Commands:**
    * **Root Directory**: `backend` (This is crucial as your `app.js` is inside the `backend` folder).
    * **Build Command**: `npm install`
    * **Start Command**: `node app.js`
4.  **Add Environment Variables**: In Render's service settings, add your `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` as environment variables.
    * `MONGO_URI`: `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string`
    * `JWT_SECRET`: `a_very_secret_key_for_jwt`
    * `PORT`: `5000` (or leave blank if Render auto-assigns it, but explicitly setting it can prevent issues as per [Render Docs](https://render.com/docs/web-services#port-binding))
5.  **Deploy**: Render will build and deploy your backend, providing a public URL for your API.

## 🪴Usage

1.  **Access the Live Demo**: Open [https://zippy-gumdrop-c1bd83.netlify.app](https://zippy-gumdrop-c1bd83.netlify.app) in your browser.
2.  **Sign Up / Log In**: Use the "Login" button in the header to create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
3.  **Explore Properties**: Use the search bar on the homepage or navigate to the "Explore" view to browse properties. Apply filters like location, price, type, amenities, and rating.
4.  **View Property Details**: Click on any property card to open a detailed modal with more information, images, and booking options.
5.  **Add to Wishlist**: Click the heart icon on a property card to add it to your wishlist (requires login).
6.  **Book a Stay**: On the property details page, select check-in/check-out dates and guests, then click "Reserve Now". (Note: Payment is simulated via Stripe's frontend SDK for demonstration purposes).
7.  **Manage Profile**: Access "My Profile" to view your personal information, recent bookings, and wishlist.
